# Embracing Opportunities and Challenges Head-On

In September 2021, I embarked on a journey with Treated, a global healthcare provider that believes in health autonomy. Joining as a humble freelance translator amidst the whirlwind of the company's re-branding. With an expansion into 20 new markets, the company had enlisted nearly 70 linguists. 

Over time, my initial role began to evolve. While my skill set already exceeded the role of conducting medical translation, coordinating with the clinicians and so on, I took the job because I loved what the company represented.

### Holistic Skill Set Tailored for the Digital Age

I bring to the table a blend of skills:

- <b>SEO Mastery</br>
Recognizing that content is vital, but visibility is paramount.
Graphic Design & Video Editing: Enabling holistic project development without a need for external support.

- <b>Automation & Web Development</br>
Streamlining processes for heightened efficiency and user experience.

- <b>Content Crafting</br>
Maintaining message consistency and impact.

- <b>Digital Marketing & PPC</br>
Ensuring optimal visibility in the crowded digital realm.

## From Linguist to Regional Patient Experience Manager

An unexpected pivot occurred when Treated requested that I review an application for the Regional Patient Experience Manager role for the Netherlands. Recognizing an opportunity, I took a leap and applied. Among 47 candidates, I emerged as the chosen one. By my fifth working day, I was not just managing the Netherlands but was also overseeing Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Portugal, and Germany - all thanks to my swift grasp of the backend system after a mere 20-minute training.

## Proactive Problem-Solving: The Heart of Effective Project Management

At the core of effective project management lies the ability to anticipate, address, and adapt. My knack for problem-solving has been tried and tested on multiple fronts.

- <b>Critical Problem-Solving</br>
I addressed a major email disruption caused by a SendGrid misconfiguration. It wasn't about technical prowess, but my keen observational skills and intuition. By the next day, every issue was resolved.

- <b>Efficiency in Crisis Management</br>
When an API glitch between Icepay and our PHP-based system led to hundreds of unexecuted refunds, I swiftly cleared up the situation in 24 hours. This entailed collaborating with developers in India, catering to patients in the Netherlands, and navigating the management in the UK.

- <b>User Experience Enhancement</br>
Despite the company's sometimes laissez-faire attitude towards end-user experience, I never wavered from my commitment to excellence. My key projects include crafting interactive training for the Customer Service team in India and overhauling our fallout and automated email systems.

- <b>Empowering Team Members</br>
 Recognizing that every individual has unique strengths and learning curves, I introduced tools and resources to uplift less tech-savvy team members. This not only improved their work experience but also enhanced overall productivity.

## Mastery in Modern Web Development Technologies

In the constantly evolving landscape of web development, staying abreast of modern technologies isn’t just a preference, it’s a necessity. My experience extends into some of the most innovative and powerful tools in the industry:

- <b>NPM (Node Package Manager)</br>
 Beyond mere package installations, I've leveraged NPM for managing dependencies, ensuring that the projects I oversee have a consistent environment, reducing "works on my machine" issues and streamlining deployment processes.

- <b>Node.js</br>
This runtime has revolutionized how we think of JavaScript. My expertise in Node.js extends to building scalable and efficient backend services, capitalizing on its non-blocking, event-driven architecture to ensure optimal performance.

- <b>React</br>
In the realm of user interfaces, React stands as a beacon of efficiency and modularity. I've crafted intricate, dynamic, and responsive UIs harnessing its component-based architecture, ensuring not only aesthetic appeal but also functional finesse.

- <b>Next.js</br>
Recognizing the importance of server-side rendering for performance and SEO, I've employed Next.js for its seamless integration with React. This has allowed me to deliver faster page loads, enhanced user experiences, and improved search engine rankings.

- <b>Deploying JS on the Edge</br>
In an era where latency can be a deal-breaker, I've taken to deploying JavaScript at the edge. This strategy reduces the distance between the user and the application logic, ensuring lightning-fast responses and a superior user experience. Tools like Cloudflare Workers and AWS Lambda@Edge have been instrumental in this approach, allowing me to serve users from global locations with minimized latency.

Harnessing these tools and technologies, I ensure that the digital projects I manage are not only built on a foundation of cutting-edge tech but are also optimized for performance, scalability, and user engagement. The modern web demands modern solutions, and with this suite of tools, I am well-equipped to deliver just that.

## Proficiency with Linux Operating Systems

A successful digital project often relies on the robustness of its underlying systems. My expertise extends deep into the world of Linux Operating Systems, underlined by my hands-on experience with.

- <b>Debian</br>
Leveraging its hallmark stability, I've utilized Debian in multiple server configurations, ensuring continuous, fault-free operations.
Ubuntu: With its blend of user-centric design and vast community support, I've championed numerous projects on Ubuntu, optimizing its innate adaptability and efficiency.

- <b>Kali</br>
Reflecting my commitment to comprehensive system understanding and security, I've utilized Kali's advanced penetration testing and security auditing tools, fortifying projects against potential vulnerabilities.

- <b>Mint</br>
Appreciating the fine balance of performance and aesthetics, I've often harnessed Mint's optimized performance coupled with its sleek design for various projects.

- <b>Deepin</br>
Standing out with its elegant design and user-friendly experience, I've explored Deepin for its unique blend of style and substance. It’s a testament to my belief in employing not just the most efficient, but also the most engaging tools available.

With the ability to navigate these diverse Linux environments seamlessly, I ensure peak performance, stringent security, and flawless integrations, regardless of the chosen platform. This foundational OS knowledge solidifies my capability to manage and oversee intricate digital projects with precision and foresight.

## Bridging the Communication Gap

Acting as the fulcrum between management and developers, I ensure smooth information flow. I demystify technical complexities for the management while aligning developers with the broader company vision, ensuring everyone sails in the same direction.
